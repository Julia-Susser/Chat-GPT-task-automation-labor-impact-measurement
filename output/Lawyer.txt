1. Research Legal Precedents: The first subtask requires a deep-dive research to collect all the legal precedents relevant to the case. This involves studying public records, legal databases, and past case files. Understand the judicial interpretations, summarize findings and make a list of cases with similar circumstances and their resolutions.

2. Analyze & Draw Comparisons: With the gathered historical data, the subsequent step is to analyze and draw parallels between precedents and the current case. This involves comparing the facts, interpreting legal implications and evaluating the strategy adopted in previous cases.

3. Predict Outcomes: Based on the analysis, the final task is to formulate probable outcomes of your current case. Considering all possible angles, judgements and repercussions, weigh the likely consequences to prepare well for any eventualities in court. This prediction will facilitate the development of a robust legal strategy.

Example: 

A real estate lawyer, Jane, is hired by a client to help resolve a zoning dispute. The client wants to build a secondary structure in his backyard, but his neighbourhood homeowner's association (HOA) does not allow structures that exceed a certain height. 

In order to construct a compelling argument, Jane conducts deep research into relevant legal precedents. She looks into both local and national regulations and laws associated with residential zoning and HOA restrictions. Using a legal research database, she reads through the cases where an HOA rule conflicted with a homeowner's construction plans.

She also explores specific cases where homeowners successfully appealed against an HOA rule, particularly focusing on the nature of the rulings and the legal reasoning employed by the judges in those cases. Jane also delves into public records and existing property documents, like the client's house deed, to find any information that could tip the scales in her client's favor. All these efforts help her understand how case law interprets similar situations.

Jane then documents and summarizes her findings. She organizes the legal precedents into different categories based on their potential impact and relevance to the client’s case. She also records the distinctions and similarities between previous cases and her current case, focusing on the arguments that were successful and the interpretations that led judges to rule in a particular way.

With this research, Jane is able to construct a robust case for her client, arguing that the height restriction violates the client's property rights. She uses the legal precedents to show that the courts have previously favored homeowners in similar situations, and therefore, her client should be allowed to carry on with the construction as planned.

Unfortunately, as a language model developed by OpenAI, I can't perform real-world tasks like a real estate lawyer in practice. However, I can help guide you through the various steps that such a lawyer may take. 

First, the real estate attorney would meet their client to discuss the case and understand the issues with the homeowner's association. They would then collect all necessary documents related to the zoning dispute. This would include the city or county zoning ordinance, the rules and regulations of the homeowner's association, the deed to the property, and any other documentation related to the dispute.

Next, they would review all these documents and conduct a thorough legal research to find relevant case law, statutes, regulations, and previous cases. Online legal databases such as LexisNexis or Westlaw might be used for this part of the process. This research would be used to form the foundation of their argument in the dispute. After, the attorney would draft a legal document, often a demand letter or a motion to the court, in order to resolve the dispute.

If the case isn't resolved through negotiation or other means, the attorney would then represent the client in court. They would argue the case before the judge, using their knowledge of property law and the evidence gathered. They would aim to convince the court that the homeowner's association's zoning rules are unjust or that the client's property rights haven't been violated.

Throughout this entire process, the attorney would remain in close communication with their client, updating them on the situation and discussing possible courses of action. The ultimate goal is to protect the client's property rights and settle the dispute in the client's favor.
